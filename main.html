	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I've always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and becoming a developer allows me to be part of that transformation. I enjoy solving problems, creating things from scratch, and constantly learning. Software development is a field where creativity meets logic, and it gives me the tools to build solutions that can improve lives, automate tasks, and bring ideas to reality. My goal is to grow both personally and professionally while contributing meaningfully to the tech industry.
